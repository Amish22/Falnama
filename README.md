# Falnama

This is a creative project for an Art History Course. 

Falnama is a book of omens used by fortune tellers in Iran, India and Turkey during the 16th and 17th centuries.
Individuals seeking insight into the future would engage in a series of purification rituals, turn to a random 
page in the Falnama, and interpret the text and drawings thereon for good or ill.

This project is a digital Falnama that uses a dice for randomization and takes a buzz feed-esque approach to the prognostications 
which are centered around super hero characters primarily from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
